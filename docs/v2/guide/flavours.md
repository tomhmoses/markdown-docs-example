# Flavour Management

Your Machine v2 can handle 12 flavours of ice cream, including up to 3 flavours of sorbet.

> [!TIP]
> Sorbet must be loaded into slots marked with 'üçß'

1. Use the touch screen on your Machine v2 to indicate which flavours you intent to swap
    - The machine will then perform a rinse cycle to clean these slots. This may take up to 5 minutes.
2. The screen will guide you through the process of removing and replacing your tubs.
